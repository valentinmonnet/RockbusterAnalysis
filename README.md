# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Initiative

I am currently analyzing Rockbuster Stealth's extensive dataset to address crucial business questions essential for strategizing their operations. My focus is on identifying top and bottom-performing films, analyzing rental durations, delineating customer geographics, pinpointing regions with high-value customers, and comparing sales across different regions, all through advanced SQL techniques. Stay tuned for actionable insights that could shape their future strategy.

## Project Overview

Hired by Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a traditional movie rental company now navigating the competitive pressures from streaming services, I am tasked with leading the data strategy for their forthcoming online video rental platform. By leveraging SQL, I will dissect various datasets to equip Rockbuster's management with robust, data-driven insights, pivotal for their 2020 strategic planning.

## Key Analytical Questions

Which films are critical for revenue generation?
What is the average rental duration for our movies?
What are the demographics of Rockbuster's customer base?
Where are our high-value customers located?
How do our sales figures vary across different regions?

## Project Context and Data Utilization

This project employs SQL for comprehensive data analysis, responding to inquiries from various departments and bolstering decision-making for the transition to online services. The skills developed here are widely applicable, demonstrating problem-solving prowess in data analytics. The data encompasses Rockbuster's film inventory, customer interactions, and transactional details, structured within a PostgreSQL database to mirror real-world business dynamics and interrelations among diverse data tables.
